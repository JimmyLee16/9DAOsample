# Cardano impact & benefit

The curated and diverse educational content will help the Cardano community develop a comprehensive understanding of decentralized governance.\
As understanding deepens, participation in on-chain governance will increase â€” especially through Voltaire and dRep voting mechanisms.\
By introducing real DAO tools (e.g., Summon Platform, ClarityDAO, TempoVote), we help the community gain hands-on experience with on-chain voting, while also promoting DAO tools built on Cardano.\
Mini-games will provide real-world testing of these tools in a low-risk environment, demonstrating their effectiveness and encouraging inter-community collaboration.\
The project directly supports the Cardano governance ecosystem, making it easier for users to:\
Participate in dRep and Catalyst-style votes\
Understand the governance mechanisms of projects they invest in\
Compare governance models efficiently
