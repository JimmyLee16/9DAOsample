# Why ?

### A. Blockchain world

ETHDAO and ARBDAO once proposed to withdraw ecosystem funds worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The proposals were approved with almost no community awareness or participation — similar to what happened with [LUNA-UST’s](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-fall-of-terra-luna-explained-by-experts) collapse caused by one unnoticed governance vote.

Some major DAOs have become victims of the very governance models they claim to uphold. In the case of [**BadgerDAO**](https://rekt.news/badger-rekt/) (2021), a governance participant approved **malicious code** embedded in a smart contract, resulting in over **$120 million in losses**. The community lacked proper review mechanisms, and most token holders either didn’t vote or didn’t understand the proposal’s implications.

In the case of **Solend** (on Solana), the DAO team rushed an emergency proposal to seize control of a whale’s wallet, with only a few dozen participants voting within hours. The move sparked **heavy backlash** and was **later reversed**. This incident reveals the lack of education, transparency, and genuine participation in many DAOs—leaving them vulnerable to manipulation and poor decision-making.



### **B. Cardano**



* Cardano has introduced an on-chain governance model based on:
  * An interim constitution
  * A Delegated Representative system (DReps)
* Despite this, community participation remains low:
  * Only **\~1.5% of staking wallets** participated in the latest test vote
  * Only **\~10% of the total staked ADA** was used for voting
* These numbers suggest:
  * Limited understanding of the DRep system among ADA holders
  * Low awareness of the importance of community involvement in governance decisions

I also encountered this problem when participating in the sharing and propaganda **Cardano Constitution** in our community. Most people do not understand what a decentralized governance system must have, what is considered a decentralized governance.

Besides, decentralized governance is extremely complex, different in the size of a project as well as the type of project. For example, the governance of an L1-based blockchain is certainly very different from that of a Dapp.

DAO documents are often only found through the project's own sources and are incompletely reported in the media. There is not a single source that describes, statistics, analyzes, and compares decentralized governance models.
