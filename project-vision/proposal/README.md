# Proposal

### PROBLEM

#### A. Blockchain world

ETHDAO and ARBDAO once proposed to withdraw ecosystem funds worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The proposals were approved with almost no community awareness or participation ‚Äî similar to what happened with [LUNA-UST‚Äôs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-fall-of-terra-luna-explained-by-experts) collapse caused by one unnoticed governance vote.

Some major DAOs have become victims of the very governance models they claim to uphold. In the case of [**BadgerDAO**](https://rekt.news/badger-rekt/) (2021), a governance participant approved **malicious code** embedded in a smart contract, resulting in over **$120 million in losses**. The community lacked proper review mechanisms, and most token holders either didn‚Äôt vote or didn‚Äôt understand the proposal‚Äôs implications.

In the case of **Solend** (on Solana), the DAO team rushed an emergency proposal to seize control of a whale‚Äôs wallet, with only a few dozen participants voting within hours. The move sparked **heavy backlash** and was **later reversed**. This incident reveals the lack of education, transparency, and genuine participation in many DAOs‚Äîleaving them vulnerable to manipulation and poor decision-making.

#### **B. Cardano**

* Cardano has introduced an on-chain governance model based on:
  * An interim constitution
  * A Delegated Representative system (DReps)
* Despite this, community participation remains low:
  * Only **\~1.5% of staking wallets** participated in the latest test vote
  * Only **\~10% of the total staked ADA** was used for voting
* These numbers suggest:
  * Limited understanding of the DRep system among ADA holders
  * Low awareness of the importance of community involvement in governance decisions

I also encountered this problem when participating in the sharing and propaganda **Cardano Constitution** in our community. Most people do not understand what a decentralized governance system must have, what is considered a decentralized governance.

Besides, decentralized governance is extremely complex, different in the size of a project as well as the type of project. For example, the governance of an L1-based blockchain is certainly very different from that of a Dapp.

DAO documents are often only found through the project's own sources and are incompletely reported in the media. There is not a single source that describes, statistics, analyzes, and compares decentralized governance models.



### PROPOSED SOLUTION

***

#### **Solution 1: Community Education & Engagement**

* We will regularly share knowledge about **decentralized governance, DAO concepts, and Cardano‚Äôs Voltaire era** across platforms where our team has strong community presence and reputation, including:
  * **Cardano ADA Vietnam Facebook Group** ‚Äì 48,000+ members
  * **Telegram Channel** ‚Äì 1,150+ members
  * Other active Vietnamese Cardano community groups on Telegram and Facebook
* To increase interaction and hands-on experience, we will **organize mini-games** using **Cardano DAO tools** such as:
  * [SummonPlatform.io](https://summonplatform.io)
  * ClarityDAO
  * TempoVote
*   Example activity:

    > Community members will vote on which Cardano native token should be used as a game reward.\
    > This simple mechanic helps users experience **how decentralized decision-making works** in practice.
* We will **collaborate with other projects** to co-host games and expand reach.

***

#### **Solution 2: Educational Content on Governance Models**

We will produce a structured series of content to help the community understand and compare governance models:

* Create educational resources covering **9 prominent DAO governance models**, divided into 3 content sets:
  * Each set includes:
    * **2 projects on Cardano**
    * **1 project from another blockchain ecosystem**
* Content formats will include:
  * **Analytical articles**:
    * 1‚Äì2 articles per project (1,000‚Äì2,000 words each)
    * Comparative articles between models (1,000‚Äì2,000 words)
  * **Whiteboard explainer videos**:
    * 1 per project (8‚Äì10 minutes each)
  * **Interactive quizzes**:
    * 5 questions per article to help readers review key concepts
  * **Livestream sessions**:
    * 1‚Äì2 hours per set for open discussion and Q\&A

***

#### **Solution 3: Cross-Project Collaboration**

To expand the impact and reach of our work, we will:

* **Co-produce educational videos and clips** with other Cardano projects
* **Co-publish articles** through mutual platforms and social channels

> These partnerships will help amplify DAO education and promote Cardano governance tools across multiple communities.

#### üîç **Expected Positive Impact**

* The curated and diverse educational content will help the Cardano community develop a **comprehensive understanding of decentralized governance**.
* As understanding deepens, **participation in on-chain governance** will increase ‚Äî especially through Voltaire and dRep voting mechanisms.
* By introducing real DAO tools (e.g., [Summon Platform](https://summonplatform.io), ClarityDAO, TempoVote), we help the community **gain hands-on experience with on-chain voting**, while also promoting **DAO tools built on Cardano**.
* **Mini-games** will provide real-world testing of these tools in a low-risk environment, demonstrating their effectiveness and encouraging **inter-community collaboration**.
* The project directly supports the **Cardano governance ecosystem**, making it easier for users to:
  * Participate in dRep and Catalyst-style votes
  * Understand the governance mechanisms of projects they invest in
  * Compare governance models efficiently
