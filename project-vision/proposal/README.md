# Proposal

#### 🔍 **Expected Positive Impact**

* The curated and diverse educational content will help the Cardano community develop a **comprehensive understanding of decentralized governance**.
* As understanding deepens, **participation in on-chain governance** will increase — especially through Voltaire and dRep voting mechanisms.
* By introducing real DAO tools (e.g., [Summon Platform](https://summonplatform.io), ClarityDAO, TempoVote), we help the community **gain hands-on experience with on-chain voting**, while also promoting **DAO tools built on Cardano**.
* **Mini-games** will provide real-world testing of these tools in a low-risk environment, demonstrating their effectiveness and encouraging **inter-community collaboration**.
* The project directly supports the **Cardano governance ecosystem**, making it easier for users to:
  * Participate in dRep and Catalyst-style votes
  * Understand the governance mechanisms of projects they invest in
  * Compare governance models efficiently
