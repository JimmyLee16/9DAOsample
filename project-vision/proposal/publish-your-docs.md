# How ?

#### ✅ **Our Proposed Solutions**

***

#### **Solution 1: Community Education & Engagement**

* We will regularly share knowledge about **decentralized governance, DAO concepts, and Cardano’s Voltaire era** across platforms where our team has strong community presence and reputation, including:
  * **Cardano ADA Vietnam Facebook Group** – 48,000+ members
  * **Telegram Channel** – 1,150+ members
  * Other active Vietnamese Cardano community groups on Telegram and Facebook
* To increase interaction and hands-on experience, we will **organize mini-games** using **Cardano DAO tools** such as:
  * [SummonPlatform.io](https://summonplatform.io)
  * ClarityDAO
  * TempoVote
*   Example activity:

    > Community members will vote on which Cardano native token should be used as a game reward.\
    > This simple mechanic helps users experience **how decentralized decision-making works** in practice.
* We will **collaborate with other projects** to co-host games and expand reach.

***

#### **Solution 2: Educational Content on Governance Models**

We will produce a structured series of content to help the community understand and compare governance models:

* Create educational resources covering **9 prominent DAO governance models**, divided into 3 content sets:
  * Each set includes:
    * **2 projects on Cardano**
    * **1 project from another blockchain ecosystem**
* Content formats will include:
  * **Analytical articles**:
    * 1–2 articles per project (1,000–2,000 words each)
    * Comparative articles between models (1,000–2,000 words)
  * **Whiteboard explainer videos**:
    * 1 per project (8–10 minutes each)
  * **Interactive quizzes**:
    * 5 questions per article to help readers review key concepts
  * **Livestream sessions**:
    * 1–2 hours per set for open discussion and Q\&A

***

#### **Solution 3: Cross-Project Collaboration**

To expand the impact and reach of our work, we will:

* **Co-produce educational videos and clips** with other Cardano projects
* **Co-publish articles** through mutual platforms and social channels

> These partnerships will help amplify DAO education and promote Cardano governance tools across multiple communities.
