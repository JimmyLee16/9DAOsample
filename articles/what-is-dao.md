# What is DAO

## INTRODUCTION

Can you imagine organizing a system or network with other people around the world, where participants don’t need to know each other, can set their own rules, and make their own autonomous decisions, all encoded on a Blockchain?

One of the main features of cryptocurrencies is that they operate in a decentralized way. This means they are not controlled by a single entity such as a government or central bank, but instead are distributed across many types of computers, networks, and nodes. Inspired by the decentralization of cryptocurrencies, a group of developers introduced the idea of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, in 2016.

Let’s go through some basic characteristics of a DAO in part 1 of this DAO article series.

## I. Some Definitions of DAO

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an organization represented by transparent rules encoded as a computer program, controlled by the organization’s members, and not influenced by a central authority. Because the rules are embedded in code, no managers are needed, removing hierarchical or bureaucratic barriers (according to Wikipedia).

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a new form of legal structure. In this structure, there is no central governing body, and all DAO members typically share a common goal and strive to act in the best interests of the organization. Popularized by cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiasts, DAOs are used to make decisions using bottom‑up management approaches.

Basic comparison between decentralized and centralized governance.

| Centralized Governance                                                   | Decentralized Governance                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Decisions are made by a single leader or small group (e.g., CEO, board). | Decisions are made collectively by token holders or members.               |
| Fast decision-making, but prone to bias or abuse of power.               | Slower decision-making due to voting, but more democratic and transparent. |
| Limited participation — most members have little or no voice.            | Broad participation — every member can contribute and vote.                |
| Information and control are concentrated, less transparent.              | Voting records and rules are public on-chain, ensuring transparency.       |

## II. How Does a DAO Work?

DAOs' activities mainly rely on smart contracts. These logically encoded agreements make decisions based on underlying blockchain activity. For example, depending on the outcome of a decision, certain code may be executed to increase the circulating supply, burn a selected amount of reserve tokens, or issue specific rewards to existing token holders.

The voting process for DAOs is publicly posted on a blockchain. Users usually must choose between mutually exclusive options. Voting rights or voting power are typically allocated to users based on the number of tokens they hold. For example, a user holding 100 DAO tokens would have twice the voting power of someone holding 50 tokens.

The theory behind this practice is that users who invest more in the DAO are incentivized to act in good faith. Imagine a user holding 25% of the total voting power. This user could engage in malicious behavior; however, doing so would endanger the value of the 25% they own.

## III. Advantages and Limitations of DAO

## A. Advantages

Decentralization. Decisions affecting the organization are made by a collective of individuals rather than a central authority, often involving many more people than traditional models. Instead of relying on the actions of one individual (e.g., a CEO) or a small group, DAOs can distribute authority across a wide user base.

Participation. Individuals in an organization may feel more empowered and connected when they have a direct voice and voting rights in every issue. While their voting power may not be strong, DAOs encourage token holders to vote, burn tokens, or use their tokens in ways they believe are best for the organization.

Transparency. In a DAO, votes are cast on the blockchain and are publicly viewable. This requires users to act in ways they believe are best, since their votes and decisions are visible. It encourages actions that benefit voters’ reputations and discourages harmful actions against the community.

Community. The DAO concept encourages people from all over the world to come together seamlessly to build a shared vision. With just an internet connection, token holders can interact with others wherever they live.



## B. Limitations

Speed: If a public company is guided by a CEO, decisions can be made quickly. In a DAO, everyone has the chance to vote, requiring longer voting times, especially across time zones and external priorities.

Education: Similar to speed, DAOs must educate more people on the entity’s operations. It’s easier for a single CEO to grasp company developments, while DAO token holders may have different backgrounds, knowledge of initiatives, incentives, or resource access. While DAOs bring diverse people together, they must learn to strategize and communicate as one unit.

Inefficiency: DAOs risk operating inefficiently. Because of the time needed to educate voters, communicate initiatives, explain strategies, and onboard new members, DAOs may spend more time discussing changes than implementing them.

Security: Like all digital blockchain platforms, DAOs face security issues. Implementing a DAO requires significant technical expertise; without it, DAO operations may not be valid for voting or decision‑making. Trust may be broken, and users may leave if they cannot rely on the DAO’s structure. Even with cold wallets or multi‑sig wallets, DAOs may be exploited, treasuries stolen, or manipulated.



## C. Comparison Table of Pros and Cons

| **Decentralization** – Decisions are made collectively by members, not a central authority, distributing power more widely.  | **Speed** – Decision-making is slower since everyone must vote, with delays across time zones and external priorities.            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Participation** – Members feel empowered and connected by having a direct voice and voting rights.                         | **Education** – Diverse members may have different knowledge and resources, making it harder to align and understand initiatives. |
| **Transparency** – All votes and decisions are recorded on the blockchain and viewable publicly, encouraging accountability. | **Inefficiency** – DAOs can spend more time discussing, educating, and onboarding than implementing changes.                      |
| **Community** – Brings together people worldwide with just an internet connection to build a shared vision.                  | **Security** – Requires strong technical expertise; DAOs may be hacked, manipulated, or have treasuries stolen.                   |

## CONCLUSION

We hope this article helps readers form a basic understanding of what a DAO is. However, it’s important to note that each system or network has different sizes, participant numbers, and complexity levels.&#x20;

For example, a DAO at a base blockchain with a diverse ecosystem will differ from a DAO at a dApp.&#x20;

Future DAO models will need to adapt to these factors. In later articles, we’ll try to select and introduce the best DAO models at different levels of each system or network.
