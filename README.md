## Foreword

Hello, I have been part of the Cardano ecosystem and community since 2020. Throughout this journey, I have had the opportunity to engage with various projects, communities, and Cardano governance activities.

Currently, I serve as:

- **Admin** of a large Cardano community with tens of thousands of members  
- **Cardano Ambassador**  
- **Vietnam Constitutional Delegate**  
- **Pool operator**

From my hands-on experience within Cardano, I have come to realize that decentralized governance is not only a core pillar of any blockchain ecosystem but also one of its most frequent activities. It manifests across all levels:

- At the ecosystem-wide level  
- Within individual projects  
- Among local communities  
- Even within small groups of people with a shared purpose  

Yet, one critical question often remains unanswered in governance discussions:  
**“What are the strengths and weaknesses of decentralized governance across different blockchain ecosystems?”**

If we could explore this question through structured surveys or case studies—similar to how DAOs such as **Minswap** and **Liqwid** operate—I believe the insights would be *fascinating and highly valuable*.

This is precisely why I decided to create this documentation project: to collect, analyze, and consolidate different models of decentralized governance across the blockchain world and at every level of practice.

The idea and groundwork for this initiative started more than two years ago. Importantly, this is a **public resource**—and whether I receive external support or not, I am committed to continuing its development, as a personal contribution to the broader community.
